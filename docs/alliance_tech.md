### Development Tree

| Node | Name               | PSTK Lv | SYNZ Lv | Status      | Estimated EXP Gap |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------: | ------: | ----------- | ----------------: |
| 2    | Quick Construction |       9 |       8 | SYNZ Behind |         7,000,000 |
| 3    | Great Helper       |       7 |       8 | SYNZ Leads  |        +1,500,000 |
| 7    | Coin Output        |       8 |       4 | SYNZ Behind |        10,000,000 |
| 8    | Quick Research     |       8 |       9 | SYNZ Leads  |        +1,000,000 |
| 9    | Senior Scientist   |      10 |       9 | SYNZ Behind |         8,000,000 |
| 15   | Veteran Craftsman  |       9 |       7 | SYNZ Behind |        10,500,000 |
|      | Total Dev Gap      |         |         |             |   ~**35,500,000** |

### War Tree

| Node | Name               | PSTK Lv | SYNZ Lv | Status      | Estimated EXP Gap |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------: | ------: | ----------- | ----------------: |
| 1    | Unit Load Capacity |       4 |       2 | SYNZ Behind |           700,000 |
|      | Total War Gap      |         |         |             |      ~**700,000** |

Combined Target Gap: 36,200,000 EXP

## Estimated Catch-up Timeline

Assuming a full 100-member alliance and focusing only on these nodes:

| Activity Level        | Daily Alliance EXP | Days to Catch Up |
| --------------------- | -----------------: | ---------------: |
| Standard (F2P Active) |            770,000 |       `~47` Days |
| Optimized (F2P+P2P)   |            924,000 |         ~39 Days |
| Hardcore (P2P)        |          1,100,000 |         ~33 Days |

Assuming pstk now tech tree moving at 1/3 rate of SYNZ. It might `add 10~15 days` to catch the worthy tech nodes. `~60` days to eliminate the tech tree gap.

## Alliance Donation Analysis

Daily Contribution Breakdown
* Free Donations: You gain 1 donation chance every 20 minutes, totaling 72 chances per 24 hours.
* Average Points per Donation: A standard donation provides roughly 100 base points.
* Critical Hits (Crits): Randomized multipliers (x2, x5, x10) significantly boost the total. With average luck, 72 free donations typically result in 7,000+ points without spending gems.
* Diamond Donations: Players can donate up to 50 additional times using diamonds. Spending until the 50-diamond cost milestone adds roughly 2,300 points to the daily total. 

Common Alliance Targets
* Most competitive alliances set daily or weekly minimums to ensure steady tech progression:
* Minimum Daily Requirement: Often set at 5,500 to 6,000 points to ensure basic activity.
* High-Activity Target: Active players who never let their donation stack (max 25) hit 0 often reach 8,500 points without diamonds.
* Weekly Minimums: Frequently set around 30,000 to 40,000 points. 

Tips for Maximizing Contribution
* The "Reset Strategy": Save your 20-25 donation chances for the daily reset. Use them all at once to increase your chances of hitting high-multiplier crits and securing top daily ranking rewards.
* Priority Tech: Always donate to the technology marked with a star (Priority) by Alliance Leaders. This often provides a +20% bonus to contribution rewards.
* Avoid Over-stacking: Your donation chances stop accumulating once they reach 25. Check in at least every 8 hours to ensure you aren't wasting potential free donations. 

Estimated Time to Reach 8.0 Million EXP
Assuming all 100 members are active:
| Player Activity Level | Avg. Daily EXP per Player | Total Alliance Daily EXP | Days to reach 8.0M |
| --------------------- | ------------------------: | -----------------------: | -----------------: |
| Moderate (F2P)        |                    ~6,500 |                  650,000 |         ~12.3 Days |
| High (F2P + Luck)     |                    ~7,700 |                  770,000 |         ~10.4 Days |
| Hardcore (Daimonds)   |                  ~10,000+ |               1,000,000+ |          ~8.0 Days |
